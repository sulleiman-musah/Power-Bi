# Uber Trip Data Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber trip data from Kaggle with the goal of understanding vehicle usage, trip locations, and travel trends.  
Using Power BI, the dataset was cleaned, modeled, and visualized to reveal insights into rider behavior, demand patterns, and vehicle utilization.

The story is told not just through visuals, but through the numbers that shape Uber’s operations.

## What the Numbers Revealed

### Trips by Vehicle Type
- Sedans accounted for 42% of total trips  
- SUVs made up 27%  
- Luxury vehicles represented 8%  

**Insight:** Affordability drives demand, while luxury vehicles serve a smaller but profitable market segment.

---

### Trips by Location or Region
- The top three pickup zones accounted for over 55% of total trips  
- Midtown alone contributed 22,400 trips  

**Insight:** Uber could deploy more drivers in these hotspots to reduce wait times and improve service coverage.

---

### Trends Over Time
- Daily average: 1,600 trips per day  
- Peak usage: Fridays and Saturdays (2,200+ trips per day)  
- Monthly trends: 15% dip in January, followed by strong summer growth  

**Insight:** Demand is seasonal and weekend-driven, aligning with leisure and social activities.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to improve Uber’s operations and customer experience:

1. **Optimize Driver Distribution:**  
   Allocate more drivers to high-demand areas such as Midtown and the top pickup zones during peak hours to minimize wait times and cancellations.

2. **Dynamic Pricing Strategy:**  
   Adjust pricing dynamically during weekends and high-demand seasons (summer months) to balance demand and maximize profitability.

3. **Targeted Vehicle Expansion:**  
   Encourage more sedan and SUV drivers to join the platform, as these vehicle types represent over two-thirds of all trips.

4. **Demand Forecasting:**  
   Use historical trends to forecast trip volumes and plan driver availability accordingly, especially during weekends and holidays.

5. **Customer Incentives:**  
   Introduce discounts or loyalty programs during off-peak hours and low-demand months (e.g., January) to maintain steady usage.

These actions can help Uber enhance its service efficiency, rider satisfaction, and overall revenue performance.
